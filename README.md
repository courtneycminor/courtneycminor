### Hello! I'm Courtney.

ðŸ¤  I am an Appalachian State University Alumna with a BSBA in Finance and Banking. 

ðŸ§  I have a heavy interest in being a part of an innovative and evolving work environment, where collaborating with colleagues from diverse backgrounds is praised. My passions for creativity, inclusion, and analytics have motivated me to seek out careers that incorporated these and as a result, that is how I came across data analytics. 

ðŸ“Š Currently, I am enrolled in Udemy's certification course titled "The Data Analyst Course: Complete Data Analyst Bootcamp 2023", while also building my professional portfolio website. On my website, I am aiming to start off with 4 projects, each focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, and Sentiment Analysis.

ðŸŽ“ I am also planning on returning to school to obtain a masters degree in Data Analytics. 

âœ¨ I am always open to chat about new opportunities, particularly in Financial Technology (Fintech), User Experience (UX) Research, Analytics and Design, and Data Visualization.
